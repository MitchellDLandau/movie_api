API Application
Durring this project I made the server side API that will be used to help run my Marvel movie application. I was
directed to have endpoints that can allow you to log in, view all movies, add and remove a movie from your favorites,
update your information, and delete your account in this project. With all of this functionality I plan to be able to
make a movie application that can access all of the information stored in a MongoDB database while the API is hosted on
another website.

As I was focussing on the brief I decided I wanted to add extra functionality. I added an admin function so that
specified endpoints can only be accessed if you have been made an admin. Admins can post new movies, update movies, get
all users, find a specific user, and delete movies from the database. This was something that was not asked of me
however I researched the methods I could use to do this and came up with a functional API that can have a moderator
level (can use the endpoints listed previously) and an admin level (can directly edit the database itself and create
admins). I also added extra functionality with the addition of an endpoint that will return all movies a given hero
stars in.

The admin function was the hardest portion for me to do in this whole application as it added many endpoints as well as
adding another layer of functions that I had to restrict to specific users. I also heavily focused on security so that
no user can add unexpected information with any of their logins or puts being made to the database. This was a very
interesting task and allowed me to branch out into more capable server side programming than was needed for an
introduction to node.js and server side programming. I look forward to working on server side applications in the future
as this was very interseting and fun to troubleshoot.
